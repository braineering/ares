Botnets are networks made up of unaware remote-controlled computers, typically instructed for malicious purposes.
Their first priority is to spread unnoticed, because in this way they may generate huge profits.
They extend infecting computers with malwares — namely bots — that force them to join the network, unwittingly.
In this work we describe the implementation of a bot, though for botnets with a centralized command and control layer.
The developed bot is thought as an educational showcase, but it is actually ready to interact with a real web controller and it is configurable via a convenient web-based interface.
