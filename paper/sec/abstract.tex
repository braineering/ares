Botnets are networks made up of unaware remote-controlled computers, typically instructed for malicious purposes.
Their first priority is to spread unnoticed, because, in this way, they may generate huge profits.
They extend infecting computers with malwares — namely bots — that force them to join the network, unwittingly.
The infected computers are then controlled via a command and control layer convenientely instructed by an attacker.
In this work we describe the implementation of a botnet with a centralized command and control layer.
The developed botnet is thought as an educational showcase, but nevertheless it can be used both for local testing and real web scenarios.
