\section{Further improvements}
\label{sec:further-improvements}

The presented botnet is intended as an educational showcase, so it should certainly be improved.

A deeper code inspection on bot dependencies should be conducted, so to allow the adoption of more aggressive code shrinking and obfuscation.

The bot should perform more advanced attacks and local system analyzes.
It should provide encrypted communication with the C\&C and be able to optimize actions scheduling to enforce concealment — e.g. taking into account the trends of legitimate usage on the infected system.
It should also be provided with a dynamic Domain Generation Algorithm to reach the C\&C, rather than a static configuration file.

Furthermore, the C\&C server should provide protection against unauthorized access — e.g. dashboard login and indexing avoidance.
