The presented bot is just an educational showcase, but nevertheless it should be improved.

A depper code inspection on legitimate frameworks the bot depends on should be conducted. Thi way would allow the adoption of more aggressive code shrinking and obfuscation.

The bot should perform more advanced analyzes of local system and networks. It should provide encrypted communication and be able to optimize actions scheduling to enforce concealment â€” e.g. taking into account the trends of legitimate usage on the infected system.
