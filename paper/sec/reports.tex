\section{Reports}
\label{sec:reports}

The bot can send to the controller reports containing \textit{current bot configuration}, \textit{scheduled attacks}, \textit{local system analysis} and \textit{local networks analysis}. Each section is attached to reports, if requested in configuration (see options \texttt{cnfInfo}, \texttt{tgtInfo}, \texttt{sysInfo} and \texttt{netInfo} in \ref{sec:configuration}). Since the first two sections are self-explanatory, we focus here only on local system and networks analysis.\\

The local system analysis includes the following components:
\begin{description}
  \setlength\itemsep{1em}
    \item [browsers] list of browsers installed on system.
	\item [hostName] name associated with the host machine
	\item [kernelVersion] version of the system kernel
	\item [osArch] name of the system's architecture
  	\item [osName] name of the operating system
  	\item [osVersion] version of the operating system
  	\item [userName] name of the active user on the host
\end{description}
\;

An example of system analysis is the following:
\begin{verbatim}
{
  "browsers" : "Google Chrome; Safari;",
  "hostName" : " MacBook Pro di Michele",
  "kernelVersion" : " Darwin 15.5.0",
  "osArch" : "x86_64",
  "osName" : "Mac OS X",
  "osVersion" : "10.11.5",
  "userName" : " Michele Porretta (micheleporretta)"
}
\end{verbatim}

The local networks analysis includes the following components:

\begin{description}
  \setlength\itemsep{1em}
  \item [Item1] aa
  \item [Item2] aa
  \item [Item3] aa
\end{description}
