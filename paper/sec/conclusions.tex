\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this work we showed the implementation of a botnets with centralized C\&C layer. The developed botnet is fundamentally thought as an educational showcase, but it is actually ready to serve in a real web scenario.
The implemented architecture makes it really easy to extend the interactions between the bot and the C\&C server for educational experimentations.
Our bot is configurable and instructable by convenient web-based dashboard.
