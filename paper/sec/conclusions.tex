\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this work we showed the implementation of a bot for botnets with centralized C\&C layer. The developed bot is fundamentally thought for testing and educational showcase, but it is actually ready to interact with a real web controller.
The implemented architecture makes it really easy to extend the bot code for educational experimentations.
Our bot is configurable and instructable by convenient web user interfaces.
